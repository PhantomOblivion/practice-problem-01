        I think of myself as a traveler not just moving across places, but across moments. Every journey begins with curiosity—the quiet excitement of not knowing what waits ahead. I’ve watched the sun rise over unfamiliar streets, tasted food whose names I couldn’t pronounce, and learned how a smile can bridge language gaps. Trains, buses, and long walks have taught me patience, while missed turns often led to the best stories.
        <br> <!-- I have written my experience in the paragraph. -->
        <br>
        Travel has shown me that the world is both vast and deeply connected. In different countries, I found the same warmth in shared tea, the same laughter in simple jokes, and the same hopes reflected in strangers’ eyes. Each place I visited left something with me—a new habit, a new way of thinking, or a deeper appreciation for home. In the end, traveling changed me more than any destination ever could.
